GNU Ghostscript
========================
https://www.gnu.org/software/ghostscript/#TOCintroduction
Ghostscript is the name of a set of software that provides:

An interpreter for the PostScript language and the PDF file format,
A set of C procedures (the Ghostscript library) that implement the graphics 
capabilities that appear as primitive operations in the PostScript language, and
A wide variety of output drivers for various file formats and printers.

Obtaining GNU Ghostscript
==========================
GNU Ghostscript is a copyrighted work; it is distributed under the GNU General Public License. 
You can get the current version of GNU Ghostscript by Internet FTP from 
ftp.gnu.org/gnu/ghostscript from any of the GNU distribution sites; likely, 
alpha versions may be available on alpha.gnu.org/gnu/ghostscript.
The Ghostscript source code distribution requires the jpeg library, 
the zlib compression library, optionally the libpng image format library, 
Jasper (for JPEG2000 format support), expat, freetype, jbig2dec, lcms and tiff. 
The versions eventually included in the distribution sources contain some modifications 
essentials to Ghostscript and not included upstream for the moment.


Portable Document Format (PDF)
===================================
Standardized as ISO 32000, PDF is a file format developed by Adobe in 1992 to present documents, 
including text formatting and images, in a manner independent of application software, 
hardware, and operating systems.[2][3] Based on the PostScript language, 
each PDF file encapsulates a complete description of a fixed-layout flat document, 
including the text, fonts, vector graphics, raster images and other information needed to display it.
