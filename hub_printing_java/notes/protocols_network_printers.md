The Line Printer Daemon protocol/Line Printer Remote protocol (or LPD, LPR)
is a network protocol for submitting print jobs to a remote printer. The original implementation of LPD was in the Berkeley printing system in the 2.10 BSD UNIX operating system in 1988; the LPRng project also supports that protocol. The LPD Protocol Specification is documented in RFC 1179.[1] LPD printing normally happens over
port 515.

AppSocket, also known as Port 9100, RAW, JetDirect, or Windows TCPmon
is a protocol that was developed by Tektronix.[2][3] It is considered as 'the simplest, fastest, and generally the most reliable network protocol used for printers' though 'it also offers no security and is often an attack vector with printers'.[3] AppSocket printing normally happens over 
port 9100.

The Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) 
is an Internet protocol for communication between client devices (computers, mobile phones, tablets, etc.) and printers (or print servers). IPP can run locally or over the Internet. Unlike other printing protocols, IPP also supports access control, authentication, and encryption, making it a much more capable and secure printing mechanism than older ones. IPP is supported by over 98% of printers sold today. IPP printing normally happens over 
port 631.
